### My Nvim Config
---
This was my setup before going to a full LUA config (still working on it). I used this mostly for C# and Unity game development.
I put this together over some time/while I was learning this whole VIM thing, so things might look wierd but It works and I tried 
to comment as much as possible. 

*I'll update this at some point with directions on how to get it all working on Windows 10 because tutorials for C#/Omnisharp VIM on Windows are scarce 
to say the least*
